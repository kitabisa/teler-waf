**teler-waf** is a comprehensive security solution for Go-based web applications. It acts as an HTTP middleware, providing an easy-to-use interface for integrating IDS functionality into existing Go applications. By using teler-waf, you can help protect against a variety of web-based attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection by facilitates [teler IDS](https://github.com/kitabisa/teler-waf).

The package comes with a standard [`net/http.Handler`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Handler), making it easy to integrate into your application's routing. When a client makes a request to a route protected by teler-waf, the request is first checked against the teler IDS to detect known malicious patterns. If no malicious patterns are detected, the request is then passed through for further processing.

In addition to providing protection against web-based attacks, teler-waf can also help improve the overall security and integrity of your application. It is highly configurable, allowing you to tailor it to fit the specific needs of your application.

## Features

Some core features of teler-waf include:

- HTTP middleware for Go web applications.
- Integration of **teler IDS** functionality.
- **Detection of known malicious patterns** using the teler IDS.
  - Common web attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection, etc.
  - CVEs, covers known vulnerabilities and exploits.
  - Bad IP addresses, such as those associated with known malicious actors or botnets.
  - Bad HTTP referers, such as those that are not expected based on the application's URL structure or are known to be associated with malicious actors.
  - Bad crawlers, covers requests from known bad crawlers or scrapers, such as those that are known to cause performance issues or attempt to extract sensitive information from the application.
  - Directory bruteforce attacks, such as by trying common directory names or using dictionary attacks.
- Configuration options to **whitelist specific types of requests** based on their URL or headers.
- **Easy integration** with many frameworks.
- **High configurability** to fit the specific needs of your application.

Overall, teler-waf provides a comprehensive security solution for Go-based web applications, helping to protect against web-based attacks and improve the overall security and integrity of your application.

## Install

To install teler-waf in your Go application, run the following command to download and install the teler-waf package:

```console
go get github.com/kitabisa/teler-waf
```

## Usage

Here is an example of how to use teler-waf in a Go application:

1. Import the teler-waf package in your Go code:

```go
import "github.com/kitabisa/teler-waf"
```

2. Use the `New` function to create a new instance of the `Teler` type. This function takes a variety of optional parameters that can be used to configure teler-waf to suit the specific needs of your application.

```go
waf := teler.New()
```

3. Use the `Handler` method of the `Teler` instance to create a `net/http.Handler`. This handler can then be used in your application's HTTP routing to apply teler-waf's security measures to specific routes.

```go
handler := waf.Handler(http.HandlerFunc(yourHandlerFunc))
```

4. Use the `handler` in your application's HTTP routing to apply teler-waf's security measures to specific routes.

```go
http.Handle("/path", handler)
```

That's it! You have configured teler-waf in your Go application.

### Examples

## Limitations

Here are some limitations of using teler-waf:

- **Performance overhead**: teler-waf may introduce some performance overhead, as the application firewall and teler IDS will need to process each incoming request. This can potentially slow down the overall performance of your application, especially if you have a high volume of traffic. Benchmark:

> **Note**: It's important to note that the benchmarking results for execution time, byte allocation, and heap allocation may vary and may not be consistent. Those results were obtained when there were **1545** CVE templates and the [teler-resources](https://github.com/kitabisa/teler-resources) dataset may have increased since then, which may impact the results.

- **Configuration complexity**: Configuring teler-waf to suit the specific needs of your application can be complex, and may require a certain level of expertise in web security. This can make it difficult for those who are not familiar with application firewalls and IDS systems to properly set up and use teler-waf.
- **Limited protection**: teler-waf is not a perfect security solution, and it may not be able to protect against all possible types of attacks. As with any security system, it is important to regularly monitor and maintain teler-waf to ensure that it is providing the desired level of protection.
